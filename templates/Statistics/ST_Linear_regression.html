    <h3>What is Linear Regression?</h3>
    <p>
        Linear regression is a method used to build a model that shows how a result depends on one or more factors.
        If there's only one factor influencing the result, it’s called simple linear regression. If several factors are involved,
        it’s called multiple linear regression. This line helps show how one factor (called the independent variable) affects another
        (called the dependent variable).
    </p>

    <h3>Behind the Scenes: How Linear Regression Works</h3>

    <h4>Step 1: Understanding the Goal</h4>
    <p>
        In linear regression, we’re looking to find the "best fit" line through our data points. This line is described by the equation:
        <code>y = mx + b</code>, where:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>y</strong> is the dependent variable (output we’re predicting).</li>
        <li><strong>x</strong> is the independent variable (input).</li>
        <li><strong>m</strong> is the slope of the line (how steep the line is).</li>
        <li><strong>b</strong> is the intercept (where the line crosses the y-axis).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Our task is to find values for <strong>m</strong> and <strong>b</strong> that make this line best represent our data points.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 2: Visualizing the Data</h4>
    <p>
        If we plot our points: (1, 3), (2, 4), and (3, 5), we see that these points almost form a straight line,
        hinting that a linear relationship might be a good fit.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 3: Calculating the Slope (<i>m</i>)</h4>
    <p>
        The slope <strong>m</strong> tells us how much <strong>y</strong> changes when <strong>x</strong> increases by 1.
        Here’s how we calculate it:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Calculate the average of the <strong>x</strong> values and the average of the <strong>y</strong> values:
            <ul>
                <li>Average of x = (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 = 2</li>
                <li>Average of y = (3 + 4 + 5) / 3 = 4</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Calculate how much each x and y value deviates from their averages:
            <ul>
                <li>For x: deviations are (1 - 2), (2 - 2), (3 - 2) → -1, 0, +1</li>
                <li>For y: deviations are (3 - 4), (4 - 4), (5 - 4) → -1, 0, +1</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Multiply each x deviation by its corresponding y deviation and add up the products:
            <ul>
                <li>(-1)(-1) + (0)(0) + (1)(1) = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Sum the squares of the x deviations:
            <ul>
                <li>(-1)^2 + 0^2 + 1^2 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Divide the total from step 3 by the total from step 4 to get the slope:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>m = 2 / 2 = 1</strong></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        This tells us that for every 1-unit increase in x, y increases by 1.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 4: Calculating the Intercept (<i>b</i>)</h4>
    <p>
        The intercept <strong>b</strong> tells us the starting point of our line when x = 0. Here’s how we calculate it:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>We already have the averages of x and y, which are 2 and 4, respectively.</li>
        <li>
            Plug the averages and slope m into the line equation to solve for b:
            <ul>
                <li>4 = (1)(2) + b</li>
                <li>b = 4 - 2 = 2</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        So, our intercept <strong>b</strong> is 2.
    </p>

    <h4>Final Equation</h4>
    <p>
        Putting it all together, our best-fit line equation is:
        <code>y = 1x + 2</code>.
    </p>

    <h4>Step 5: Understanding Why This Equation is "Best"</h4>
    <p>
        This line minimizes the distances between the line and each data point in a vertical direction (these distances are called errors or residuals).
        In linear regression, we choose <strong>m</strong> and <strong>b</strong> values that make the total squared error as small as possible,
        which gives us the most accurate line for predicting <strong>y</strong> values based on <strong>x</strong>.
    </p>

    <h4>Intuition</h4>
    <p>
        Let’s say we’re studying the effect of sunlight on plant height. Imagine we collect data from three plants with different sunlight exposure per day
        (for example, 2 hours, 4 hours, and 6 hours) and measure their heights (say, 10 cm, 14 cm, and 18 cm).
        Using linear regression, we’re looking to find a line that best represents the relationship between sunlight and plant height. This line won’t
        necessarily pass through every point, but it will capture the overall trend: as sunlight increases, plant height tends to increase. This trend line
        allows us to make predictions about plant height for other amounts of sunlight, even if we don’t have direct data for every level of exposure.
        The line is the best fit because it reduces the overall difference between the actual data and the trend we’re estimating, giving us a reliable
        model for this relationship.
    </p>

    <h4>Summary of Key Takeaways</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Slope (m):</strong> Shows how much y changes with each unit of x.</li>
        <li><strong>Intercept (b):</strong> Shows where the line starts when x = 0.</li>
        <li><strong>Best fit:</strong> Achieved by minimizing the squared error, balancing the line across the points.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This step-by-step process helps create a more intuitive understanding of how linear regression calculates the best line for a given set of data.

    <h3>Important Terms</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Independent Variable:</strong> This is the factor that you think influences the outcome.
            It’s what you are testing or changing. For example, it could be the amount of sunlight a plant gets.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Dependent Variable:</strong> This is the outcome or result that you are measuring or predicting.
            It changes based on the independent variable. For example, in plants, it could be the height of the plant.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Slope:</strong> This tells you how much the dependent variable (the result) changes for every
            increase in the independent variable. For instance, if you increase sunlight, the slope shows whether
            the plant’s height grows more or less.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Intercept:</strong> This is where the line crosses the Y-axis (the vertical line on a graph).
            It shows the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero.
            For example, it shows how tall the plant is when it gets no sunlight.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Regression Line:</strong> The straight line that best fits the data points. This line shows the
            general direction or trend of the relationship between the two variables.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Residuals:</strong> These are the small differences between the actual data points and where
            the regression line predicts they would be. It’s like the gap between what you predicted and what actually
            happened.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>R-squared (R²):</strong> This is a measure of how well the regression line fits the data.
            It tells you the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the
            independent variable. The closer R² is to 1, the better the model fits the data.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Coefficient:</strong>  This is the value that multiplies the independent variable in the
            equation of the regression line. It's similar to the slope and shows how much change in the dependent
            variable is expected with a one-unit change in the independent variable.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>P-value:</strong> In some cases, especially when testing hypotheses, the p-value tells you
            whether the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is statistically significant.
            A low p-value (typically less than 0.05) indicates that the relationship is significant.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Outliers:</strong> These are data points that don’t fit the general trend of the data.
            Outliers can sometimes affect the slope and intercept of the regression line and might need special
            attention.
        </li>
    </ul>
