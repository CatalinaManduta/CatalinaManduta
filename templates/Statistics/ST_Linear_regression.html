        <h3>What is Linear regression?</h3>
        <p>Linear regression is a method used to understand the relationship between two things and to make predictions.
            Imagine drawing a straight line that best fits a bunch of points on a graph. This line helps show how one
            thing (called the independent variable) affects another (called the dependent variable).</p>

        <h3>Important terms</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Independent Variable:</strong> This is the factor that you think influences the outcome.
                It’s what you are testing or changing. For example, it could be the amount of sunlight a plant gets.</li>
            <li><strong>Dependent Variable:</strong> This is the outcome or result that you are measuring or predicting.
                It changes based on the independent variable. For example, in plants, it could be the height of the plant.</li>
            <li><strong>Slope:</strong> This tells you how much the dependent variable (the result) changes for every
                increase in the independent variable. For instance, if you increase sunlight, the slope shows whether
                the plant’s height grows more or less.</li>
            <li><strong>Intercept: </strong>  This is where the line crosses the Y-axis (the vertical line on a graph).
                It shows the value of the dependent variable when the independent variable is zero.
                For example, it shows how tall the plant is when it gets no sunlight.</li>
            <li><strong>Regression Line:</strong> The straight line that best fits the data points. This line shows the
                general direction or trend of the relationship between the two variables.</li>
            <li><strong>Residuals:</strong> These are the small differences between the actual data points and where
                the regression line predicts they would be. It’s like the gap between what you predicted and what actually
                happened.</li>
            <li><strong>R-squared (R²): </strong> This is a measure of how well the regression line fits the data.
                It tells you the proportion of the variation in the dependent variable that is explained by the
                independent variable. The closer R² is to 1, the better the model fits the data.</li>
            <li><strong>Equation of the Line:</strong> The formula for a straight line in linear regression is usually
                written as:<code> y=mx+b </code>
            where:
                y is the dependent variable (what you are predicting),
                m is the slope (how much y changes as x changes),
                x is the independent variable (the factor you are using to predict),
                b is the intercept (the value of y when x is zero).
            </li>
             <li><strong>Coefficient:</strong>  This is the value that multiplies the independent variable in the
                 equation of the regression line. It's similar to the slope and shows how much change in the dependent
                 variable is expected with a one-unit change in the independent variable.</li>
            <li><strong>P-value: </strong> In some cases, especially when testing hypotheses, the p-value tells you
                whether the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is statistically significant.
                A low p-value (typically less than 0.05) indicates that the relationship is significant.</li>
            <li><strong>Outliers:</strong> These are data points that don’t fit the general trend of the data.
                Outliers can sometimes affect the slope and intercept of the regression line and might need special
                attention.</li>
        </ul>
