            Snooker is a cue sport played on a rectangular billiards table covered with a green cloth called baize, with six pockets.
            First played by British Army officers stationed in India circa 1875, the game uses twenty-two balls (pictured) – a white cue ball,
            fifteen red balls, and six other balls collectively called "the colours". Using a snooker cue, individual players (or teams)
            take turns to strike the cue ball to pot the other balls in a predefined sequence, accumulating points for each successful
            pot and for each foul committed by the opposing player/team. An individual frame of snooker is won by the player or team
            that has scored the most points. A snooker match ends when a player/team has won a predetermined number of frames.
            The standard rules of snooker were first established in 1919. As a professional sport, snooker is governed by the
            World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. Top players of many nationalities compete in regular tournaments
            around the world, earning millions of pounds on the World Snooker Tour.</p>
